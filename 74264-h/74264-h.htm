<h2><a id="THE_FLYING_PARLIAMENT"></a>THE FLYING PARLIAMENT<br><br>
<i>Scene. Venice, November, 1917. The piazza of San Marco.</i></h2>

<p>A chill air emphasizes the weather stains on arcade and collonade. Now
and then the pale sunlight glitters faintly on a bit of mosaic, but the
lacy fretwork of St. Marks and the Palazzo Giustizia are nearly covered
by sandbags and scaffoldings. The statues are all removed from their
pedestals. The four famous bronze horses are once more removed; also the
giants on the famous clock tower. The winged lion of St. Mark and the
little St. Theodore and his crocodile have been carried to places of
safety. From the bronze flagstaffs in the Piazza of St. Marks the
Italian flags are flying. From afar off there comes the slow booming of
guns. Suddenly the piazza is a whirl with pigeons. The guns sound like
huge bass chords; the pigeon wings beat a curious suggestion of delicate
pastoral themes. The canals are deserted except for one gondola slowly
approaching a bridge. An American war correspondent wields the great oar
unaccustomedly. The American steps out at a bridge; he makes fast the
gondola; he walks slowly into the deserted piazza. Near the bronze base
of the flagstaffs is a single child standing among the whirling pigeons.
The child has a small bit of black bread in his hand; now and then he
breaks off a tiny bit of the bread and throws it to the birds who come
eagerly to him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_14">{14}</a></span></p>

<p>Child looking at pigeons circling in the sky speaks as though to them:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanzaital">
<span class="i0">Fly&mdash;Fly! Where?<br></span>
<span class="i0">In the unlibertied air!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wings of gray instinct,<br></span>
<span class="i0">All opal tinct,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pulses of pleasure,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Feathery measure&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wings of delicate vibrant life,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cutting blue air with halcyon knife;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sky-strewn garlands of pleasant days,<br></span>
<span class="i0">No more your turret and tower ways!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nowhere&mdash;nowhere<br></span>
<span class="i0">Do hearers your sweet counsels share!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nowhere&mdash;nowhere<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is your place in the militant air!<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The American advances slowly; he is clad in khaki, and carries field
glasses; his broad brimmed hat is worn down low over his eyes which,
burned out and weary, are fixed on the Duomo of St. Marks.</p>

<p>As he notices the Italian flags, his lips close firmly together, and he
looks down at the little American flag set in his button-hole. He stares
around the deserted piazza and shivers. Taking out his notebook he sits
down on the steps of the Duomo and commences writing:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(American, writing)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here in the Piazza<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_15">{15}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Where the colonnades<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dripped with globules<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of colored beads,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where delicate shapes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Venetian glass<br></span>
<span class="i0">Expanded like flowers<br></span>
<span class="i0">In cavelike booths;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here where the band played strains,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wild and rich and forlorn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till the very stars dropped down,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Like gold tears on the night;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the moon, like an orbèd lyre,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tried to echo the strain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Through strings of fine-drawn cloud....<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here where the musing crowds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sat in the coffee stalls<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Florian’s and drank<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tiny glasses of green<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or golden yellow Chartreuse;<br></span>
<span class="i0">In a sweet dazed waking dream&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here is emptiness now,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Emptiness like a curse,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Emptiness like a house<br></span>
<span class="i0">With the light and life all gone;<br></span>
<span class="i0">All the loving turned to dread,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The children statues of Fear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The windows closed and stark,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the pictures turned to the wall,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_16">{16}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The people are fled away<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Padua and the plains,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Because the Prussian comes.<br></span>
<span class="i0">All the men are on the lagoons,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With Latin passion and pride<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fighting the Prussians back;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But here in this empty place,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thronged once by a brilliant world,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stands a little Venetian child<br></span>
<span class="i0">Feeding the hungry doves.<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Child, moving over near the American, curiously watches him at his
writing. At last the little one sits soberly down beside the war
correspondent, who smiles at him but goes on rapidly scribbling his
notes:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While up from the Lido’s calm,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where the yellow sails once sank<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into gold dusted sky;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where the great green waves crashed on<br></span>
<span class="i0">The lilac shadowed sands,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grey tides move like a dirge.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Young waters that once lapped<br></span>
<span class="i0">The dream-lanes of canals,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where marble faces smiled<br></span>
<span class="i0">In shadows green as moss,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now are wrinkled and old;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The morning-tinted shores<br></span>
<span class="i0">Are now brittle and old;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_17">{17}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And here, where on festa days<br></span>
<span class="i0">The banners clasped the breeze,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the tapestries rolled down<br></span>
<span class="i0">Over the galleries,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the air-ships, like great beads,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Buoyed them on the sun<br></span>
<span class="i0">Floating over the roofs,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those days, fanning with sails<br></span>
<span class="i0">And fairy trails of boats,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And somnolent dip of oars&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those nights, fruited with lights<br></span>
<span class="i0">Spattered with gleam and gold&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">All are ended and gone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Blasted before the guns.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Venetian people are gone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fled to Bologna’s plains,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Away from Piave’s floods<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Padua’s pallid walls.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The decadent boom of guns&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sullen, brutish guns&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tired, moody guns&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sick, disillusioned guns&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is all that comes to the ear.<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The child, sitting placidly near the war correspondent, keeps on
throwing the tiny crumbs of bread to the pigeons; the American looks at
him absently, and then bends again to his writing:<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_18">{18}</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Glutted are all the guns,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Glutted with fiendish drink<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of hot young human blood;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Brutal ennuyeux! Fat<br></span>
<span class="i0">With soft delicious food<br></span>
<span class="i0">Brought them from every land.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now the very guns are shamed;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The hideous tanks are shamed;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The fields and mountains are shamed;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Zeppelins are shamed;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The submarines are shamed;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Men’s faces are set and stern<br></span>
<span class="i0">With an solemn awful shame.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The world turns from its trough,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And knows its swinishness;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The guns are glutted now,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, if the flood be passed<br></span>
<span class="i0">On Piave’s fertile plains,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Venice shall come to their maw;<br></span>
<span class="i0">All the delicate high-bred bones<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Bride of the Seas will come<br></span>
<span class="i0">To be crunched by the wild-boar guns<br></span>
<span class="i0">Venice the fragile, grey<br></span>
<span class="i0">Queen of the lamped lagoons&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of slender lily tower&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of rich dustcovered bronze&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of history-crusted stone&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of luminous Christs and saints<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_19">{19}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And Gods of golden lands&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of dreaming palace and port&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of wingèd winy glass<br></span>
<span class="i0">And vine-hung water-gate&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Venice must go to the guns.<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The war correspondent closes his book; getting wearily to his feet he
walks around the corner of the Palazzo Giustizia and gazes out on the
Grand Canal toward the lagoons. He turns and looks sorrowfully toward
the Bridge of Sighs, to the restored Campanile and the Procurate Nuova.
The grey pigeons whirl around him; the child follows him.</p>

<p>Child looking earnestly at the American, points to the doves:</p>

<p>(<i>Child, singing</i>:)</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanzaital">
<span class="i0">There go the doves, the flowers of the water&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Leaves of the steeples and seed of the sea;<br></span>
<span class="i0">They know never our commerce nor barter,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the doves are no longer free.<br></span>
<span class="i0">All of their flight among starry steeples<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fanning of wings over militant peoples,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Brings us no harmony.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the work of the pigeons is not done,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For the work of wings is never done.<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>American looking down at the child wonderingly:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The work of wings is never done.<br></span>
<span class="i0">That, me-thinks, is a wise small song.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who gave it you to sing?<br></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_20">{20}</a></span></div></div>
</div>

<p>The child stands gazing up at the American; he keeps mysterious dark
eyes fixed upon him answering solemnly:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Woodcarver,&mdash;he sings<br></span>

chants with a weird insistence:</p>

<p>The American looks puzzled, he puts his hand on the child’s head and
searches the large mournful eyes; he mutters something under his breath,
and shakes his head sadly.</p>

at his pathos:</p>

child’s hand, stroking it tenderly and saying:</p>

<p>The child smiles doubtfully; but the tenderness in the war
correspondent’s voice gains his confidence; he slips his hand into the
stranger’s, saying almost gayly:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div>

<p>The two cross the deserted piazza toward the cálles where there are many
little shops and booths now all boarded up; one, however, remains open.
It is a small, dark, dingy cave, with small wooden angels, beautifully
carved, festooned over the doorway. As one peers into the dimness of the
interior, one has the sense of the fluttering of delicate carved wings.
The Woodcarver comes to the door; he has in one hand his chisel, in the
other a shapeless block of olive wood. The Woodcarver is old and bowed,
but as he lifts his cavernous, dark eyes he smiles, and his whole face
is irradiated with a look of the genius of simplicity.</p>

<p>Woodcarver to the war correspondent:</p>

<p>The old man paused, breathless and trembling; his hand drops weakly from
the war correspondent’s shoulder; he draws himself up, saying with
gentle dignity:</p>

<p>The American, silent and touched, looks quietly at him; there is
sympathy and understanding in his face, yet he remains coolly
reflective. The old Woodcarver staggers to his stool, and begins
fiercely cutting at the shapeless block of wood. All about the small
cavelike shop the sun strikes the smooth glistening bodies of wooden
angels, the golden brown nakedness of little cherubs.</p>

<p>The American also sitting down rolls and lights a cigarette, the child
collecting shavings and bits of wood from the floor, sits in the doorway
sorting them and arranging them in patterns.</p>

<p>The American quietly inhaling his cigarette:</p>

<p>The old Woodcarver for a moment drops his head; he passes his hand
across anguished eyes; then he points to the child sitting in the
doorstep, and puts his finger on his lip.</p>

<p>Woodcarver, fiercely:</p>

<div class="poetry">

<p>American, bitterly:</p>

<span class="i0">Seeing many little forms,<br></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>The Woodcarver stops carving; he drops his head into his hand; the
American bites his lips, and curses himself. With sombre eyes he stares
at the floor. Suddenly he notices a bit of wood lying in the shavings at
his feet. It is a half-carved cross. The war correspondent, picking it
up holds it loosely in his hand, ruminating. At last he puts it very
gently on the table near the Woodcarver’s listless arm, and turns to the
door, staring out to the grey vistas of the empty calles. As he smokes
in silence the far-off guns boom steadily, and the whirl of grey pigeons
comes once more past the little shop into the piazza.</p>

<p>The child, looking up at them, chants dreamily:</p>

</div>

<p>The Woodcarver, lifting his face from his hands, looks anxiously at the
child; he passes his rough hand swiftly over his eyes and smiles. Rising
he pats the little shoulder of the child sitting in the doorway, saying

<p>The Woodcarver turns shamefacedly back to the American, who smiles
understanding his little diversion.</p>

<p>American&mdash;You speak quaintly, in childish parlance; but I like the
fancy. What was your drollery about those who fly singly?</p>

<p>The Woodcarver, his dark eyes lighting with imagination, stands before
the stranger arms akimbo, explaining,&mdash;</p>

<p>Woodcarver shyly:</p>

<span class="i0">Her fingers in my brain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And mixed my reason up.<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The war correspondent laughs heartily at this, but the Woodcarver is
quite serious. The old man stands slightly bent in the centre of the
little place, regarding the stranger intently, and says slowly and
gravely:</p>

<p>There is a sudden tremendous sound of guns. The child flings himself on

<p>With a groan, the Woodcarver once more takes up the Christ, he runs his
skilful sensitive fingers and supple wrist along the thin side of the
young crucified figure. The American lost in thought staring at him. At

<p>As the American finishes, the child rushes, in wild excitement, crying:</p>

<p>“Master&mdash;O Master, there is a soldier come down from the front&mdash;one of
the Bersagliere&mdash;from the floods of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_53">{53}</a></span> Piave. He found a boat, and,
with his one poor hand, he has rowed it down the lagoons. The boat is
full of blood. His side&mdash;his eyes are bleeding&mdash;O Master&mdash;Master!” There
is a startled whir of the pigeons flying past, as a man’s steps are
heard dragging themselves over the stone pavement of the Calla. The
child stands petrified at sight of the wounded soldier, covered with mud
and blood, yet still wearing the draggled beaver hat with coque
feathers, the long yellow gaiters and torn blue coat. He staggers in,
makes the sign of the cross to the winged figures all about him, and
sinks coughing on a bench. His head drops forward. The old Woodcarver
falls on his knees before him, takes off his hat, and peers into his
face. The American bends over him, takes a flask from his hip pocket,
and pouring some of the contents on his handkerchief, puts it between
the man’s shaking lips.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;">

<p>Woodcarver with horror:</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>The Bersagliere sits panting, his eyes roll around the shop vacantly and
wildly. Suddenly his glance falls on the half finished wooden Christ
lying on the table. He struggles up, clutches it, and presses it to his
lips. His hands close over it, his bleeding face breaks into pitiful
sobs, and he moans like an animal.</p>

<p>The American, turning his head away, bites his lips muttering:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Their Christ&mdash;Their Christ.<br></span>

<p>The war correspondent leaves the flask in the hands of the Woodcarver,
who hangs over his friend like a woman, taking off the hat, smoothing
the battered coque feathers, stroking the hair back from the bleeding
brow.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_55">{55}</a></span> He pours water out of a flask, and bathes the grey shaking face;
he finally draws a very small fragment of his black bread from his
breast, and, with a strange passionate gesture of renunciation, offers
it to the soldier, who wolfishly snatches, and quickly devours it. He
groans with his eyes closed, then looks appealing up at the Christ in
the Woodcarver’s hand, and crosses himself.</p>

<p>The Woodcarver in a low tone to the American:</p>

<p>The American: It is like&mdash;&mdash; It is like&mdash;&mdash; The war correspondent breaks
off suddenly; he flings himself to the door clenching his hand. The
child runs to him, beckoning and pointing to sky.</p>

<p>Overhead, far above the buildings, flies a squadron of airplanes. They
are bronze, gold and silver in the sunlight. The correspondent looking
at them with his field glasses, can distinguish them as Austrian planes.
They drop no bombs. As they pass the war correspondent looks back over
his shoulder at the Woodcarver&mdash;</p>

<p>The Woodcarver is still staring up into the sky. The child steals up to
him, and slips his hand in his.</p>

<span class="i0">The Schumann “Warum” drops its pensive leaves,<br></span>
